      <h2>Dr Jack King</h2>
       I am a <a href="https://royalsociety.org/">Royal Society</a> University Research Fellow, working in the <a href="https://www.se.manchester.ac.uk/about/schools/engineering/">School of Engineering</a> at the University of Manchester. After an MEng at the University of Cambridge I completed my doctoral studies at the University of Edinburgh. I joined the University of Manchester as a post-doctoral research associate in 2017, and was awarded a Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Fellowship in 2022, and a Royal Society University Research Fellowship in 2023.

       <h1>Ruofeng Feng</h1>
       Ruofeng joined as a postdoctoral research associate in January 2024, and is developing new techniques for adaptivity in mesh-free combustion simulations, and researching bluff-body flame dynamics.

       <h1>Lucas Gerken-Starepravo</h1>
       Lucas started his PhD in September 2023, and is working on the development of machine learning techniques to accelerate mesh-free simulations of combustion phenomena.
